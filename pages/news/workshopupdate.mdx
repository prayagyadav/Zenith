# Workshop held successfully on 22-24 April 
> Zenith Team on 24th April 2025 


The Zenith Astronomy Club, University of Hyderabad sucessfully held a three-day workshop titled 'The Astronomer's Toolkit: Mastering Data and Observations" on 22-24th April 2025

We saw the participation of 55 astronomy enthusiasts from various University schools and departments. Each day featured two informative talks followed by a hands-on session. Participants learned 
about things such as FITS file manipulation, plotting and analysing Hertzsprung-Russell Diagrams, and conducting Morphological studies of Galaxies among many other interesting concepts.


We would like to convey our gratitude to Dr. Priya Hasan, Prof. S.N Hasan, and Dr. Mridusmita Buragohain for their insightful sessions and in making this workshop successful.
