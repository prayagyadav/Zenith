# International Day of Light 2025
> Zenith Team on 17th May 2025

Marking a global celebration of the impact of light in science, technology, art, and education, the International Day of Light 2025 was celebrated on May 16-17 at TIFR Hyderabad. On Day 2 of the International Day of Light 2025, the Zenith Astronomy Club, University of Hyderabad, had the privilege of participating in a dynamic chapter meet organized by TIFR Network of Students (NeSt), in collaboration with its Optica and SPIE student chapters — part of the international society for optics and photonics.

Student chapter members, including from our Zenith Astronomy Club, showcased their ongoing research, providing a platform for knowledge exchange and intellectual engagement. Dr. Sachin Barthwal delivered an inspiring talk titled “Quantum Leap from Classroom to Modern Life: An Industry Perspective,” bridging the gap between academic knowledge and industry application. Our Zenith Astronomy Club highlighted its ongoing initiatives, achievements, and challenges, contributing to a roundtable discussion focused on exploring future collaborative opportunities.
