# Parade of the Planets Stargazing Session
> Zenith Team on 25st January 2025

On the 25th of January 2025, the Zenith team organized a stargazing session for the much awaited Parade of the Planets phenomenon,
where the planets in our solar system align in a straight line. We had an students form the university community, students from the
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Hyderabad (TIFR-H),and faculty along with family from both institutions. We had an overwhelming
response for the event making it possibly the largest event organized by the Club so far. On this clear night, we had the privilege
to witness Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and the Orion Nebula, with the highlight of the night being Jupiter and all its moons lined up to 
give us a beautiful spectacle.
