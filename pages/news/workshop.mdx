The Zenith Astronomy Club, University of Hyderabad, is delighted to announce a three-day workshop on "The Astronomerâ€™s Toolkit: 
Mastering Data and Observations", with a special focus on astronomy data handling and image processing using Python.

This workshop will provide participants with hands-on experience in working with astronomical image data, introducing techniques for enhancing and analyzing photographs captured using telescopes and CCD cameras. Participants will learn to use Python and relevant scientific libraries for data manipulation and image enhancement.
Participation is limited and will be allotted on a first-come, first-served basis. Selected participants will receive a confirmation mail and will be added to a WhatsApp group. 
We invite students, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in astrophysics, astronomy, and computational data analysis to join us for this engaging and insightful workshop.
