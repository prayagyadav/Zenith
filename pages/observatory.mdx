## Dr. Nandivada Ratnashree

<div className='flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center justify-center'>

<p> Dr Nandivada Rathnasree was the self-effacing director of Delhi’s Nehru Planetarium who popularised astronomy among generations of school and college kids for more than two decades. Under Rathnasree’s stewardship, Nehru Planetarium became one of the city’s iconic institutions — a popular spot for children and young adults across north India and a go-to place for enthusiasts during astronomical events.</p>

Rathnasree, who had a PhD on stellar evolution from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and did post-doctoral research on pulsar astronomy at University of Vermount, US, was the director of the planetarium for 22 years since 1999. She was also a foremost expert on the Jantar Mantar complexes in Delhi, Jaipur and Varanasi. \
“As mandated by Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, of which the planetarium is a part, Rathnasree attended office till April 18 or 19. She came down with a fever and cough on April 20. We consulted doctors on the phone and treated her at home because there was no bed in hospitals,” said Patrick Dasgupta, Rathnasree’s husband and a professor of physics and astrophysics at Delhi University.
Dasgupta said her condition deteriorated on April 30. “Her oxygen level fell to 72. I frantically took her in an ambulance to six-seven hospitals through the night but could not get a bed. On May 1, we managed a bed at DRDO’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Covid Centre. She was being given oxygen and her levels were being monitored. She was improving till May 8 evening, but her condition worsened suddenly in the early hours of May 9 and she left us,” said an emotional Dasgupta. It was mainly due to Rathnasree’s untiring efforts that that the planetarium became a people-centric institution, said Ajay Talwar, an astro-photographer and vice-president of Amateur Astronomers Association Delhi, who had known her since 1999.
“She was always engaging with and encouraging students, trying to get them topics for research etc. And she was always overworked. Not because someone was piling work on her but because she was always taking up new projects all by herself,” Talwar said. \
It was under Rathnasree’s leadership that the planetarium started conducting public watch programmes during astronomical events, which got massive response. She was closely involved with all new programmes developed for the public at the planetarium’s popular sky show for which a new digital projector was acquired some years ago. “She developed special programmes on Prof Yashpal just after he died and on Prof Govind Swaroop last year, as well as on scientists such as Meghnad Saha,” said Dasgupta.
Her achievements apart, it was Rathnasree’s human qualities that endeared her to the staff, said Mahender Kumar Jain, who retired as the planetarium administrator in 2017. “She would also be at the side of the staff, sharing their joys and sorrows. That was her biggest quality,” Jain said.
