# Parade of Planets on June 3rd 2024

The alignment of six planets in our solar system. 
This stunning visual display is referred to as the ‘Parade of Planets.’ 
The alignment will feature Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune sharing a common path across the sky.
The best time to witness this in India is just before dawn, at around 4:30 to 5:30 AM.
