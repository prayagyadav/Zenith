It is true to say that one doesn’t truly grasp the vastness of space until they have perfectly tuned a telescope against a planetary body! Being part of this club was more than just stargazing—it was about building a community that shares a love for the universe. Seeing Zenith grow into what it is today makes me incredibly proud, and I’m honored to have been a part of its foundation."
